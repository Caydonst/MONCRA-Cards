**NEW GAMEPLAY IDEA**
- Each realm stage will have a boss to fight
- Each boss will get harder and harder
- You can play single player or multiplayer
- As bosses get harder, you will need to play your cards more strategically to output the most damage
- It will remain a turn based game but player characters will not be shown, only their HP bars
- Bosses will have their own skills they play on their turn
- If playing multiplayer, the boss will either attack 1 player or all players

*Maybe implement RPG mechanics later like tank, dps, and healer*
- *Players will choose a class before the game starts, and during the game, they will get cards respective to their class*
